========================================================================================
b) Data, Data Availability, Formats, Storages
========================================================================================
Data: Anything you are able to store is called data
Data Availability: We have three types of data now

	a) Structured Data [since 1940...]
		Business data [irctc, bookmyshow etc.]
	b) Semi-Structured Data [since 2000...]
		Log, Journal etc..
	c) Unstrctured Data [since 2005]
		Social  media [whatsapp, twitter, etc.]
		Docs Data [word, pdf...]
		Satellite Signals etc..

Formats:
		a) File stream format [data stored in files and folders]
		b) Database format [ data stored in the form of tables]

Storages:
		a) On-Premise : With in your company storage
		b) Cloud: Storing in other organizations and connecting through web url and account


========================================================================================
c) BI, BI Tools, BI Technologies, Power BI
========================================================================================

BI : Business Intelligence or Intelligence to the Business or Decision Support to the Business

	Here we convert "Normal data" into "decision making" data.
	
	Normal Data
			Irctc tatkal booking information [pnr, amount, passengers, start dt, end dt]

	Analytical [BI] Data
			In todays tatkal, "how many" trains having full booking, "no booking","top 5 trains" having demand

BI Input: Above Data with any format and from any storage

		Legacy BI Tools: [Since 1990]
		
				Structured Data
				ON-Premises
				Less reports, less sized reports etc.
				Web / Desktop view of reports and dashboards
				
		Modern BI [Since 2010]
		
				All types of data
				On-Premises / Cloud
				More reports, more sized reports
				Web / Desktop / Mobile / Tab view of reports and dashboards
				
BI Output: Report / Dashboard

	Report
		"Individual operation" specification component [Low level data presentation]
		Company contain many reports
		Reports may be used by everone in the organation
		Many visuals and may show more rows
		
		Exmple: Cash withdraw from savings account

	Dashboard
		"Specific business functionality"[ High level business information] specification component
		Company contain less dashboards
		Dashboards used by high level resources and mgmt team in the the organation
		Simple, Cute and less visuals and show less rows
		
		Ex: Cash withdraw and deposit flow in savings account[ complete savings account analysis]

BI Process: Which is involved between Input and Output

	It is a layered process

	Input Data--> ETL--> DWH--> Semantic--> Reporting-->Decision Making
	
	General Public / Business Executives-->Input Data-->
	
	Extract Transform Load--> 
	
	Data Warehouse (Data Huge Storage Area, bigger in size for historical and incremental data storage)--> 
	
	Semantic(A Special Kind of DB Design for easy aggregates storage and analysis, small in size)-->
	
	Reporting (Reports and Dashboards)--> 
	
	Decision Making (SMEs, Managers, Vps, Data Scientists, Data Stewards, Executives etc.)

========================================================================================
Power BI Learning [Simple / Medium / Complex]
========================================================================================
Very simple to learn

Full GUI

Only the little complexity at the time of DAX [ Data Analysis Expressions]. DAX has set of functions similar to excel and we need it during
calculations and modeling.

No coding

In real time you may work with any source [ Excel, Flat file, XML file, Json File, Relational Databases (Oracle, SQL Server, Teradata), 
Data warehouses, Cubes, Cloud Applications, File Streams etc...]

But you need to have little understanding about SQL [around 8 topics] for better kick off.

We will take 3-4 hours SQL.
